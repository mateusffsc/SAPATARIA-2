  # Fix for Duplicate Financial Transactions

  This migration addresses the issue of duplicate financial transactions being created
  when order payments are processed. The main changes are:

  1. Improved Trigger Function
     - Completely rewrites the update_financial_transaction_for_payment function
     - Removes the IF NOT EXISTS condition that was causing duplicates
     - Implements a more robust approach by first deleting related transactions
     - Then recreates transactions based on the current state of payments

  2. Cleanup
     - Removes any existing duplicate transactions
     - Ensures proper reference_number values
*/

-- First, clean up any existing duplicate transactions
WITH duplicates AS (
  SELECT 
    id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY reference_id, reference_type, reference_number, date, amount 
      ORDER BY created_at DESC
    ) as rn
  FROM financial_transactions 
  WHERE reference_type = 'order'
)
DELETE FROM financial_transactions 
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM duplicates WHERE rn > 1
);

-- Drop existing trigger functions to recreate them with fixes
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS create_financial_transaction_from_payment() CASCADE;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_financial_transaction_for_payment() CASCADE;

-- Create a completely rewritten function that handles all financial transaction operations
